-- This is just a placeholder migration file to demonstrate the migrations system.
-- Our initial schema is already created by the createTables function in schema.ts.
-- Future schema changes would be added here as new migration files.

-- If we wanted to add a new field to an existing table, we would create a new migration like:
-- ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN avatar_url TEXT;

-- Just a simple comment to make this file non-empty
-- This migration is already applied by the createTables function
